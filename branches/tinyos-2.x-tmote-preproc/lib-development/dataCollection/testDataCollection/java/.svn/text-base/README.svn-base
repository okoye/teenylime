Java Application for the Routing Test
=====================================================

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS 
------------------ 
0) If not already done, add '$TOSROOT/support/sdk/java/tinyos.jar' 
to your classpath:

$ export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$TOSROOT/support/sdk/java/tinyos.jar

1) Go to '$TLROOT/lib/dataCollection/test/java/' directory and
build the java application:

$ cd $TLROOT/lib/dataCollection/test/java
$ ant clean && ant

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
------------------
1) Go to the '$TLROOT/lib/dataCollection/test/java/' directory (or the directory
where the tl.jar file is located) and launch the following command 
with the parameters related to the communication interfaces (default
sf@localhost:10001):

$ java -cp tl.jar tl.apps.routingTest.Launcher [-comm <source>]

, in the case there are more than one sink connected to the
same application repeat the -comm <source> for each of them.

2) The log files are saved in the test_log/ directory.

LOG STRUCTURE
-------------
The file containing routing information is test_log/routing_info.txt. It
contains two different kind of records, structured in the following way:

RECORD 1

ID node_id 
SEQ_NO sequence_number 
PACK_FW packets_forwarded_best_effort packets_forwarded_class_1 
packets_forwarded_class_2 
RETRIES num_of_reissued_out_for_best_effort num_of_reissued_out_for_class_1
num_of_reissued_out_for_class_2
DROPPED_DUP num_of_dropped_duplicates
OUT_RET num_of_link_level_send_called_for_out_operations
TOS_SR num_of_all_send_at_link_level num_of_all_retransmissions_at_link_level

RECORD 2

ID node_id 
SEQ_NO sequence_number 
BAT battery
PAR current_parent
P_COST parent_cost
NUM_P num_of_parent_changes
CONG_RS num_of_congestion_started_at_the_node
num_of_congestion_started_by_higher_level_nodes
DEL_OW num_of_messages_deleted_for_buffer_overflow
REC_SF num_of_successfull_recoveries num_of_failed_recoveries
RD_RET num_of_link_level_send_called_for_rd_operations
