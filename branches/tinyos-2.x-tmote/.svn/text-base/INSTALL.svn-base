TeenyLIME - Transiently Shared Tuple Space Middleware 
            for Wireless Sensor Networks

TMote/TelosB Support
=====================================================

To install TL, you must apply two patches to the TOS2 CC2420 stack. 
These are some brief directions on how to do so: 

1) Go to $TOSROOT/tos/chips/cc2420:

$ cd $TOSROOT/tos/chips/cc2420/

2) Copy the required patches from the TL system directory:

$ cp $TLROOT/tl/system/tmote/*.patch .

3) Apply the two patches:

$ patch -p0 <CC2420ActiveMessageC.nc.patch
$ patch -p0 <CC2420.h.patch

Now, you can compile your application with TL. Note the above patches
maintain backward compatibility with the standard TOS2 CC2420 stack.
