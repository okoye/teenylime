Programming 3TEC motes
======================

First, you need to PATCH the bsl.extra found in the TINYOS directory.
If you don't have the standard 'bsl.extra', please refer to the note at the
end of this document.

1. Copy 'patch.bsl.extra' to '$TOSROOT/support/make/msp'.
2. cd $TOSROOT/support/make/msp
3. Backup 'bsl.extra'
4. Apply patch:
    patch bsl.extra patch.bsl.extra


When COMPILING applications for the 3TEC mote, you should do it for the telosb
platform:

    make telosb


When you want to PROGRAM the 3TEC mote, you must:
1. Make sure that the appropriate jumper (JP2) is set on the programmer board.
2. Program the device using bsl3, for example:

    make telosb reinstall,11 bsl3,/dev/ttyUSB0

3. If you want to use the reset button on the mote, take out the jumper from
step 1.


Applicatiosn for STANDARD motes can be compiled and programmed as usual (with
bsl and NOT bsl3):

    make tmote
    make tmote reinstall,11 bsl,/dev/ttyUSB0



MANUAL PATCHING OF bsl.extra
----------------------------

Add the following line:

BSL_MODE ?= 0

before the line (#20):

MSP_BSL_FLAGS ?= --telos 

Then, right after it, add the following lines:

BSL3 ?= -1
ifneq ($(BSL3),-1)
MSP_BSL_FLAGS == --invert-test
BSL = $(BSL3)
endif
