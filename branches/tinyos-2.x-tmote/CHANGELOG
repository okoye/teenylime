April 27th - Luca
- All timing aspects handled based on the value of EPOCH
- TLConf.h contains only modifiable configuration parameters, 
  all others moved to TupleSpace.h
- Got rid of NeighborTimer in LocalTeenyLime
- Added definitions for TL_LOCAL and TL_NEIGHBORHOOD
- Renamed BridgeTupleSpace.systemIn in BridgeTupleSpace.remove
- BridgeTupleSpace.remove changed signature
- Removed references to TLTarget in ReliableGenericComm
- Introduced param MAX_RETURN_TUPLES
- Got rid of ReliableGenericComm.getSymmetricNeighborsId()	
- Inlined deleteTuple and initTuple in LocalTeenyLime
- Added isFailed() in TupleSpace.h
- Got rid of completedOps in DistributedTeenyLIME
- Changed licens from GPL to LGPL
- Bug fix when capability tuples are involved in group operations
- MutationRouting now uses only 16 bits fields
- Added benchmark application

Sometime - Laurens
- #include replaces includes
- Timer interface declaration must include timer precision in tos2
- Init and StdControl are separate interfaces in tos2

October 1st - Luca 
- operationIds are now passed with pointers intead of being
  returned as result: if the operation is local the opId gets
  written too late for the application to read it
- MessageQueue now calls AMControl.start(), otherwise the radio 
  stays off
- Added TLDebugM component to replace Leds as used within TL
- Removed all asm and uart_XXX code (hopefully), use standard TOS2 
  printf support instead
- Added printf hooks to a number of components
- Implemented tupleReplace function to manage the TL system
- Inlined addTuple in localOut
- Got rid of msg_t, uint8_t is shorter
- Changed alignment in TupleMsg
- Implemented copyTuple to avoid alignment problems while 
  receiving/sending data from/to the network
- MessageQueue was using interface NeighborSystem why(?!?)
- MessageQueue becomes TMoteMsgQueue, mostly because of TOS2 random 
  timers 
- TeenyLimeSerializer was sending all messages in broadcast (why?!?)
- Added timeTick even in BridgeTupleSpace, and used timer in LocalTL
  to tick in DistributedTL; consequently, StdControl is no longer needed
  in DistributedTL
- localTime in DistributedTL is used to signal operation completion, 
  it saves a timer and fixes the bug with multiple distributed 
  operations
- Got rid of Init interface in TeenyLimeM, TMoteMsgQueue and TLSerializer, 
  they don't need it; LocalTL and DistributedTL wired directly to Main 	 

October 4th - Luca
- TeenyLimeSerializer and TMoteMsgQueue are now in a single configuration 
  TMoteTLStack where we implement all the TMote-specific network functions
- Neighbors are now filtered according to the value of link quality, using 
  the parameter MIN_LQI in TmoteStackConf.h
- Neighbor tuples can now use two formal fields of type TYPE_LQI and 
  TYPE_RSSI that are automatically filled in by the TL System with 
  link quality estimates and RSSI values
- Fixed a bug in LocalTL: nghTuple wasn't updated
- Vaiorus clean-ups of commented out code
- Added a test for TL system
- Got rid of StdControl everywhere, as it is meant to control hw devices
  with on/off power state (see TEP 115)

October, 15th - Luca
- Added support for TOSSIM simulations in TMote branch (use 
  Makefile.micaz-tossim to compile)
- Added TOSSIM-specific components uder tl/system/micaz-tossim 
- Added compilation flag PRINTF_SUPPORT
- Removed mydbg all over, TOSSIM2 was segfaulting
- Added test for tuple expiration, fixed TLLocal so that tuples expire 
  one epoch earlier (as it should be)	

November, 18th - Luca
- Added support for telosb compilation target
- Implemented reliable (unicast) operations using CC2420 L2 PacketLink acks
- Added atomic where deemed necessary
- Various clean-ups
- Modified temporary data structures in LocalTL e DistributedTL 
  to save stack mem
- Got rid of TOS2Def 

December, 4th - Luca
- Added experimental PacketLink layer for TL based on random retransmission 
  times -> See INSTALL file for info on how to patch the standard TOS2 
  CC2420 stack

December, 6th - Luca
- Added tupleSpaceError event in TupleSpace interface. When a reliable 
  operation does not succeed, the event si signalled with all the data 
  of the failed operation. Applications must be updated to the new API.
