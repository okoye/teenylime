// For CSMA protocols:
// Although nodes do perform a carrier sense before starting to transmit the
// preamble, we still have the hidden terminal problem, and nodes may start
// transmitting at the same time.
// The scattering value should be dependent on the length of the TX preamble.
// Longer preambles require wider scattering, because they increases the chance of
// overlap.
