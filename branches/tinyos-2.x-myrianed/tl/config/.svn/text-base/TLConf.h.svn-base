// 2 Query method options:

#define GENERIC_QUERIES 0
// Option 1: Do not use generated code. Program binary will be smaller.
// Instead of turning all code generation off at once, code generation can
// be configured on a per tuple format basis in TupleDefs.h
// Generic queries do allow multiple conditions per field, and have no
// special requirements on the order of fields in a query. Queries can be like
// newQuery(q, MY_FMT, 2, eqCond(0,80), eqCond(1,80)) as well as
// newQuery(q, MY_FMT, 2, eqCond(1,80), eqCond(0,80)) as well as
// newQuery(q, MY_FMT, 2, gtCond(0,20), ltCond(0,80))

#define GENERATED_QUERIES 1
// Use generated code. Optimized query code is generated only for those tuples for which
// code generation has not been turned off in TupleDefs.h.
// Optimized queries require all conditions to respect the order of tuple fields:
// newQuery(q, MY_FMT, 2, eqCond(0,80), eqCond(1,80)) is allowed,
// newQuery(q, MY_FMT, 2, eqCond(1,80), eqCond(0,80)) is NOT allowed.
// In addition, only on condition per field is allowed:
// newQuery(q, MY_FMT, 2, gtCond(0,20), ltCond(0,80)) is NOT allowed.

// Select query method:
//#define QUERY_METHOD GENERIC_QUERIES
#define QUERY_METHOD GENERATED_QUERIES

// Most of current MAC protocols do not support varying message buffer lengths.
// They can handle message buffers of size message_t only. For these MAC
// layers, define NO_DYNAMIC_MSG_LEN, and TeenyLimeSerializer will only
// allocate fixed size buffers.
#define NO_DYNAMIC_MSG_LEN
