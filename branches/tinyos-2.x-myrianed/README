Welcome!


Example apps are present in directory "apps".
TeenyLime can be configured through the files in tl/config/.

In tl/config/, TLConf.h is the main configuration file, together with
TupleDefs.h. The latter is used to define the tuple formats that an application uses.
This file is processed by the TeenyLime preprocessor.

prerequisites for compilation:

nesc (>1.2.8)
tinyos 2
gcc compiler for the target node.
python (for TeenyLime preprocessing)
