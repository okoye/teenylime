A couple of test applications.
TeenyLime/branches/tinyos-2.x-tmote/apps/testSuite contains more test applications.

Type:

./mk LocalRd

and the application TestLocalRd.nc will be compiled. This runs the preprocessor, nesc compiler and gcc compiler.
Other test applications in this dir are compiled similarly. (TestBenchmark.nc is compiled with ./mk Benchmark)
To compile and run inside Avrora AVR simulator, type

./sim LocalRd [stack]

Optionally type "stack" at the end of the line to monitor the stack size.
To compile for tossim TinyOS simulator, type:

./tossim LocalRd


Remember first to initialize the environment for tinyos compilations by doing something like this:

export TOSROOT="/home/laurens/local/tinyos-2.x"
export TOSDIR=$TOSROOT/tos
export MAKERULES=$TOSROOT/support/make/Makerules
