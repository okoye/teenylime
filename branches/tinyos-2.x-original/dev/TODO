- MessageQueue: introduce random waiting times, get rid of scattering based on node ids


tos2:
- possibly turn modules that use timers into generic modules to support multiple timer precisions
- implement ReliableReceive.getPayload() and ReliableReceive.payloadLength().
- get rid of unnecessary copying in removeReliability() and addReliability()
- have teenylimeC provide SplitControl in stead of StdControl
- do we need UINT MAX definitions?
